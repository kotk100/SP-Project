# SP-Project: Web based timetable

This web app is primarily for students of FRI (support for other faculties can be added later) and it allows for a simpler tracking of the timetable even when exchanging lessons with other students.   

The main features of the app are <sub><sup>(hopefully will be)</sup></sub>:
- Adding and removing courses from your timetable
- Exchanging practical classes with other users
- Calculating the time you should be leaving for faculty based on bus schedule
- Creating reminders for when you should wake up or start getting ready to leave
- Importing your timetable based on your student id number
- If multiple modes of transportation are available suggesting the best one based on weather

This application will be developed and tested on the following browsers: 
- Microsoft Edge
